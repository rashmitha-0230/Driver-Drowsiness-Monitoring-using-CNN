# Driver-Drowsiness-Monitoring-using-CNN
About
Driver Drowsiness Monitoring is a safety system designed to prevent accidents caused by driver fatigue or drowsiness. This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect signs of drowsiness in real-time through facial landmarks, particularly focusing on the eyes. When drowsiness is detected, an alert is triggered to awaken the driver.

Problem Statement
Drowsiness or fatigue is one of the major causes of road accidents, especially during long drives or night-time travel. Traditional methods like caffeine intake or taking breaks are not always effective. There is a critical need for a system that can automatically detect drowsiness and issue real-time alerts to prevent accidents and save lives
